Using LLM to set up Infrastructure, Automation (CI/CD), Containerization and Orchestration, etc. As well as the test app itself.

I'm logging every action I take in [LOG.md](LOG.md) file. That's the most interesting reading here.

The idea is simple: create a sample app and setup all the infrastructure and automation for it.

**Plan:**

- [x] Create a [LOG.md](LOG.md) file to track all the actions I take
- [x] Use LLM to create [a sample project](/app/) with frontend and backend (simple LLM Chat app).
- [ ] Use LLM to setup Containerization (Docker) for the frontend and backend
- [ ] Use LLM to setup Infrastructure as a code (Ansible)
- [ ] Use LLM to create some tests (functional, e2e, etc.)
- [ ] Use LLM to setup CI
- [ ] Use LLM to setup CD
